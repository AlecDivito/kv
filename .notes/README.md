# Notes

This is a document that contains all the notes for the following
course. This isn't meant to be amazing but it's meant for me to 
document any of my questions or research i've passed and want to
remember or share somewhere. If you want some context about where
this [course](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/blob/master/courses/rust/docs/lesson-plan.md), it's created by pingcap to teach students about distrusted systems.

## Chapter 1

Learning rust and commond line applications. Learn about rusts package
manager, cargo, as well how to create and test applications.

## Chapter 2

This chapter focused on teaching us the use of Log structured storage
systems. It also went ahead and taught us about handling errors in
rust (which taught me a lot of new cool things i could do in the
language).
